# About

This site attempts to represent content from the Fedora Aqueduct project in a web friendly way.

> The Aqueduct project provides automated changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux based systems
> to meet security guidelines established by various agencies. These changes are in the form
> of Bash scripts and Puppet manifests. Each change is specific to the agency's auditing 
> criteria and granular enough to allow the system owner to decide on changes at the line item level.
